### Installation

1. **Navigate to project directory**
   ```bash
   cd nexgen_analytics
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Ensure datasets are available**
   - Place CSV files in `../datasets/` directory
   - Required files: cost_breakdown.csv, customer_feedback.csv, delivery_performance.csv, orders.csv, routes_distance.csv, vehicle_fleet.csv, warehouse_inventory.csv

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   - The dashboard will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Profit-Risk Quadrant Analysis** (Core Innovation)
- Interactive scatter plot showing profit vs delivery risk for all orders
- Visual quadrants: High Profit/Low Risk (Ideal), High Profit/High Risk (Action Needed), etc.
- Hover details with order information and customer data
- Color-coded by customer segment with size based on order value

### 2. **Machine Learning Risk Prediction**
- RandomForest classifier trained on delivery performance data
- Predicts probability of severe delays for all orders (including new ones)
- Features: Priority, Product Category, Customer Segment, Carrier, Distance, Traffic, Weather
- Cross-validated model with performance metrics

### 3. **Interactive Filtering System**
- Sidebar filters for Customer Segment, Carrier, Product Category, and Priority

- Filter statistics and reset functionality

### 4. **Carrier Performance Analytics**
- Average profit and risk score comparison by carrier
- Delivery performance metrics and on-time percentages
- Identification of best/worst performing carriers
- Actionable insights for carrier relationship management

### 5. **Customer Feedback Analysis**
- Rating distribution pie chart and issue category analysis
- Correlation between delivery performance and customer satisfaction
- Identification of orders requiring follow-up (poor ratings)
- Customer satisfaction metrics and trends

### 6. **High-Priority Order Identification**
- Top 10 high-profit, high-risk orders requiring immediate attention
- Priority scoring algorithm combining profit potential and delivery risk
- Actionable recommendations for each priority order
- Executive summary with total value at risk

### 7. **Financial Analysis & Profit Distribution**
- Profit distribution histogram with statistical markers
- Comprehensive financial metrics (mean, median, quartiles)
- Identification of loss-making and low-margin orders
- Correlation analysis with operational factors

### 8. **Report Download & Export** ‚≠ê NEW
- **Executive Summary Report**: Key metrics and KPIs for leadership
